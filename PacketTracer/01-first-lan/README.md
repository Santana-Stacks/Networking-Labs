# Lab 01: First LAN + Ping Test **Date:** 2025-09-27 **Tool:** Cisco Packet Tracer 8.x --- ## 🎯 Goal Build a simple LAN with two PCs, assign IP addresses, and test connectivity using ping. --- ## 🛠️ Steps 1. Dragged **PC0** into the workspace. ![PC0 created](./01-pc0-created.png) 2. Assigned static IP: 192.168.1.1 / 255.255.255.0 ![PC0 IP](./02-pc0-ip.png) 3. Tried `ping 192.168.1.1` → self-ping failed (Packet Tracer limitation). ![PC0 self-ping](./03-pc0-selfping-failed.png) 4. Added **PC1**, assigned IP 192.168.1.2 / 255.255.255.0. ![PC1 created](./04-pc1-created.png) ![PC1 IP](./05-pc1-ip.png) 5. Connected PC0 ↔ PC1 with **Copper Cross-Over Cable (FastEthernet0)**. ![Crossover cable](./06-crossover-cable.png) 6. From PC0, pinged 192.168.1.2 → **Success**. ![Ping success](./07-ping-success.png) --- ## ✅ Results - Green link lights confirmed connectivity. - Inter-device pings successful. - Self-pings failed (by design in Packet Tracer). --- ## 🔑 Key Takeaways - Built first LAN using Class C private IPs. - Cross-over cable is required for PC↔PC. - Ping validated end-to-end connectivity.
